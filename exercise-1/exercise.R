# Exercise 1: Creating and Indexing Vectors

# Create a vector `x` that has the values 10 through 20 in it (using the : operator)
x <- 10:20

# Create a vector `y` that has the values 21 through 30 in it (using the seq() function)
y <- seq(21, 30)

# Create a vector `z` by combining the vectors `x` and `y`
x <- c(x,y)

# Create a variable `w` that contains the 11th element in your vector `z`
w <- z[11]

# Create a vector `q` that contains the second through the 5 elements of `z`
q <- z[2:5]

# Create a variable `len` that is equal to the length of your vector `q`
len <- length(q)

### Bonus ###

# Create a vector `even` that holds the even numbers from 1 to 100
even <- seq(2, 100, 2) # start at first even number!

# Using the `all()` function and `%%` (modulo) operator, confirm that all of the
# numbers in your `even` vector are even
test <- all(even %% 2 == 0)
