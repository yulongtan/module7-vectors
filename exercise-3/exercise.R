# Exercise 3: Vector and function practice

# Create a vector `marbles` with 6 colors (representing marbles).


# Use the `sample()` function to randomly select a single marble


# Define a function called MarbleGame. This function should:
# - Takes in a single argument `guess` that is a guess at what color marble will be drawn
# - Randomly samples a marble from the vector
# - Returns whether or not the person guessed accurately (preferrably a character string phrase)


# Play the marble game by guessing a color!


# Bonus: Play the marble game until you win, keeping track of how many tries you take
# Hint, you'll need to use a `while` control structure, which is not covered in the module



## Double bonus(answer not provided): play the game 1000X (until you win) and track the average number of tries
# Is it what you expected based on the probability
