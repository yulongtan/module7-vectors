# Exercise 4: Creating and operating on vectors

# Create a vector `names` that contains your name and the names of 2 people next to you.


# Use the colon operator : to create a vector `n` of numbers from 10:49


# Use `length()` to get the number of elements in `n`


# Create a vector `m` that contains the numbers 10 to 1. Hint: use the `seq()` function


# Subtract `m` FROM `n`. Note the recycling!


# Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of numbers from -5 to 10 in `.1` increments.
# Store it in a variable `x`


# Create a vector `sin.wave` by calling the `sin()` function on each element in `x`.


# Create a vector `cos.wave` by calling the `cos()` function on each element in `x`.


# Create a vector `wave` by multiplying `sin.wave` and `cos.wave` together, then adding `sin.wave`


# Use the `plot()` function to plot your `wave`!
